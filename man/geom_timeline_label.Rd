\usage{
geom_timeline_label(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., n_max = 5, parse = FALSE,
  check_overlap = FALSE, na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_max}{The number of the max size events to display the label.}

\item{parse}{If TRUE, the labels will be parsed into expressions and
displayed as described in ?plotmath}

\item{check_overlap}{If `TRUE`, text that overlaps previous text in the
same layer will not be plotted.}
}
\description{
`geom_timeline_label` adds text directly to the timeline plot.
}
\details{
geom_timeline_label() is for adding annotations to the earthquake data.
This geom adds a vertical line to each data point with a text annotation
(e.g. the location of the earthquake) attached to each line.
There should be an option to subset to n_max number of earthquakes,
where we take the n_max largest (by magnitude) earthquakes.
Aesthetics are x, which is the date of the earthquake and label which
takes the column name from which annotations will be obtained.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_timeline understand the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are 'x' and 'label'):
\describe{
  \item{x}{datetime of the event}
  \item{label}{the text to display}
  \item{size}{the size of the circle drawn at the event}
  \item{colour}{the colour of the circle  drawn at the event}
  \item{y}{free groupiong parameter}
  }
}

\examples{
eqdta <- eq_location_clean(eq_clean_data(earthquakes)) \%>\%
filter( date > ymd("20000101") & COUNTRY=="USA") \%>\%
  head(n=5)

ggplot (data = eqdta,
        aes(
          x = date,
          y = COUNTRY,
          label = LOCATION_NAME,
          size = FOCAL_DEPTH,
          colour = EQ_PRIMARY
        )) +
  geom_timeline() +
  geom_timeline_label(n_max=6)
