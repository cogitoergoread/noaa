#' Significant earthquakes around the world
#'
#' dataset obtained from the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
#' Administration (NOAA) on significant earthquakes around the world.
#' The dataset contains information about 5,933 earthquakes over an
#' approximately 4,000 year time span.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 5962 rows and 47 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{I_D}{The unique numeric identifier of the record.}
#'   \item{FLAG_TSUNAMI}{When a tsunami was generated by an earthquake, "Tsu" appears in the Assoc Tsu column. There should also be a "TSU" link in the Assoc column which is linked to the tsunami event database. The TSU link will display additional tsunami event information in a new browser window.}
#'   \item{YEAR}{Valid values: -2150 to Present. Format +/-yyyy (-is B.C, +is A.D.) The Date and Time are given in Universal Coordinated Time (also known as Greenwich Mean Time). The local date may be one day different.}
#'   \item{MONTH}{Valid values: 1-12}
#'   \item{DAY}{Valid values: 1-31 (where months apply)}
#'   \item{HOUR}{Valid values: 0-23 }
#'   \item{MINUTE}{Valid values: 0-59}
#'   \item{SECOND}{Valid values: 0-59}
#'   \item{FOCAL_DEPTH}{Valid values: 0 to 700 km. The depth of the earthquake is given in kilometers.}
#'   \item{EQ_PRIMARY}{Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9. A measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.}
#'   \item{EQ_MAG_MW}{Mw Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9. The Mw magnitude is based on the moment magnitude scale. Moment is a physical quantity proportional to the slip on the fault times the area of the fault surface that slips; it is related to the total energy released in the EQ. The moment can be estimated from seismograms (and also from geodetic measurements). The moment is then converted into a number similar to other earthquake magnitudes by a standard formula. The result is called the moment magnitude. The moment magnitude provides an estimate of earthquake size that is valid over the complete range of magnitudes, a characteristic that was lacking in other magnitude scales. The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs. }
#'   \item{EQ_MAG_MS}{Ms Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9. The Ms magnitude is the surface-wave magnitude of the earthquake. The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.}
#'   \item{EQ_MAG_MB}{mb Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9. The Mb magnitude is the compressional body wave (P-wave) magnitude. The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.}
#'   \item{EQ_MAG_ML}{ML Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9. The ML magnitude was the original magnitude relationship defined by Richter and Gutenberg for local earthquakes in 1935. It is based on the maximum amplitude of a seismogram recorded on a Wood-Anderson torsion seismograph. Although these instruments are no longer widely in use, ML values are calculated using modern instrumentation with appropriate adjustments. The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.}
#'   \item{EQ_MAG_MFA}{Mfa Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9 The Mfa magnitudes are computed from the felt area, for earthquakes that occurred before seismic instruments were in general use. The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.}
#'   \item{EQ_MAG_UNK}{Unknown Magnitude: Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9. The computational method for the earthquake magnitude was unknown and could not be determined from the published sources. The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.}

In many cases, only a single descriptive term was available. These terms were converted to the damage categories based upon the authors apparent use of the term elsewhere.
